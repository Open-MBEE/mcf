# Introduction

Welcome to the MBEE Flight Manual. This document is intended to be an all
encompassing user manual for the Model-Based Engineering Environment (MBEE).
Below are summaries of the sections in this document:

**Section 1.0: Using MBEE** provides details on installing and running
MBEE. If you are reading the Flight Manual on an MBEE instance that you set up,
you can safely skip this section. Section 1.0 goes over MBEE basics to get
started working with MBEE, but refers to later sections for more complex uses.

**Section 2.0: For Developers** is still a work in progress, as well as the MBEE UI.
This will provide some basic information, but has deliberately been a low-priority
documentation item due to the rapidly changing UI during these early development stages.

**Section 3.0: For System Modelers**  is a section dedicated to uses and
documentation for system modelers. As MBEE is first and foremost a modeling
tool, Section 3.0 extends the "Using MBEE" content in a format that provides a
focus specific to system modeling.

**Section 4.0: Integrations** discusses API-based integrations and details the
various ways data can be integrated and exchanged with MBEE. This section
covers the MBEE API in some detail. This API-based approach allows
service-based integrations to be used to grow the environment in a horizontal
and distributed architecture. Examples of using the MBEE API can be found
in the tutorial at the end of the flight manual.

**Section 5.0: Plugins** provides detailed information on plugins. While plugins
are a type of integration, they are fundamentally different from
API-based integrations with respect to their overall architecture, their
performance capabilities, and their impact on the MBEE security posture. Due to
the unique nature of plugins, they are given their own section in this document.

Plugins are a server-side mechanism extending the capabilities of MBEE and
providing high-performance ways of integrating data into MBEE that differs from
the API-based approach. Plugins grow the monolithic core of MBEE to extend the
capability of the core framework.

**Section 6.0: Core Framework** details the inner workings of the MBEE Core
Framework (MCF). It is written by developers, for developers who may want to
modify the core framework itself. This may be done for a variety of reasons
including adding a new authentication module, modifying views or routes,
extending data models, and much more. MCF was built to be open source and was
designed with this degree of extensibility in mind.

If you're not a developer and/or don't want to dive into the inner workings of
the MBEE Core Framework, Section 6.0 can safely be skipped.

**Section 7.0 Database Abstraction** details the requirements for creating a
database strategy. Through the abstraction layer, MBEE supports different
document based databases which use a list of required functions and classes,
defined in the database strategy. See the [JSDoc](/doc/lib.module_db.html) for
more detail on function parameters and purposes.

**Appendix A: System Administration Guide** provides information specifically
for system administrators. If you plan to administer MBEE and have gone over
the basics of Section 1.0, you may want to skip straight to this appendix. This
section provides information on defining or swapping out authentication modules,
advanced MBEE configuration, using MBEE with Docker, and much more.

**Appendix B: Migrations** provides information on database migrations. This
mostly applies to system administrators but could have impacts to project data
if the database schema changes are significantly different.

**Appendix C: Database Configuration** details the different database strategies
which have been implemented, and how to configure each to run with MBEE. This
file is based on the README located in the source code in `app/db`, and is
auto-generated during build. You will not be able to view this file until
building the application.

**Reference: API Doc** is a reference to all of the MBEE API documentation.
The API documentation can be found via MBEE at the [/doc/api](/doc/api) route.

**Reference: JSDoc** provides detailed documentation of the JavaScript modules
in the MBEE Core Framework. This may be useful to those interested in modifying
the Core Framework or to those developing plugins, since plugins can leverage
the Core Framework's underlying JavaScript modules.

## About MBEE

The Model-Based Engineering Environment (MBEE) is a modeling collaboration tool
that integrates system models with multidisciplinary engineering data to enable
the system model to be a single-source of truth for project data. It makes model
data more accessible via a web-based user interface (UI) for ease of use across
disciplines and skill sets within an organization. This web-based interface
provides a mechanism for team members to interact with system model data without
needing to be a systems modeler themselves.

The goal of MBEE is to better communicate data across engineering organizations
by implementing the core goals of model-based systems engineering through
software tools. MBEE decreases ambiguity by making the concept of single-source
of truth more achievable through its RESTful API, extensible plugins, and
distributed services.

The core component of MBEE is the **MBEE Core Framework (MCF)**. This framework
implements the core capabilities of MBEE such as model management, RESTful API
endpoints, plugin management, UI framework, and more. This monolithic core
provides a centralized ecosystem for connecting distributed microservices that
are used to share inter-model data.

**Plugins** can be used to extend the capabilities of the MCF by adding new API
endpoints, creating new views and UI components, and developing new ways of
interacting with model data. This concept is key to the MBEE's core design
objective of providing a platform that can be domain-generic and easily
extensible.

**Services**, **microservices**, **desktop clients**, and other **API-based
integrations** can be used outside of the core MBEE framework to connect
external systems and multidisciplinary models to exchange and integrate data.

The figure below show the layered integration concept of MBEE

</div>

This approach allows distributed services to be used to interact with external
systems and integrate data from external models into MBEE. These services can
be cloud-based microservices, monolithic enterprise services, desktop clients,
or any number of other clients that can access a RESTful HTTP API.
