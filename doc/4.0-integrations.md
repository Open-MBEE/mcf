# Integrations

A core capability of MBEE is the ability to integrate model data from multiple
sources into a single cohesive model and to exchange data between models. This
can be achieved through a few different mechanisms, the most noteworthy of 
which is the MBEE Core Framework's (MCF) RESTful API. 

Another way of integrating data with MBEE is through plugins that extend the
core framework. Since the architecture of plugins differ fundamentally from API
based integrations, plugins are given their own section ("5.0 Plugins") in this
Flight Manual. 

## The MBEE REST API

The API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting
objects within MBEE such as users, organizations, projects, model elements,
and more. The API is documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
inline documentation in the MCF source code. This documentation is then 
generated into a viewable format accessible at the [`/doc/api`](/doc/api) route
within MBEE or by clicking on *Documentation* in the navigation bar and 
selecting *API Documentation*.

The API documentation is broken down into the following sections:

- General 
- Organizations
- Projects
- Elements
- Users 

The **General** section documents API endpoints are used for interacting 
with MBEE rather than a specific object type within MBEE. This includes a test
route that is useful for determining when the API is up, a route providing 
version information, and a route for logging into MBEE and retrieving an
authentication token.

The **Organizations** and **Projects** sections document API routes for 
manipulating organizations and projects. The **Elements** section documents
endpoints for interacting with model elements.

Finally, the **Users** section provides methods for creating, viewing, editing,
and removing users.
